Timer for Fire Emblem Draft Racing. Use at http://geeene.xyz/
Largely Inspired by the Original Racetime-Coordinator by Akd (http://schwjm.me/race-coordinator/)

If you're familiar with that timer you should feel right at home with this one :)

Otherwise:
In the FE Draft Racing community we typically run races with a certain amount of Break Time, and potentially penalties.
Allows multiple teams to join a Server Room to track the time they have been actively racing / taking break / what their total time including penalties is. 

This version has the following additional Features:
1) It is possible to maintain one timer with multiple players (i.e. Team Mode)
2) You can generate an OBS Overlay link for All Teams, or indivdual Teams only.
3) Lobby browser with password protection

Rebuilt from scratch as a Blazor .NET Core 8.0 App.
